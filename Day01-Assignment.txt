1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

Answer:

Multiplexing: HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single connection, improving efficiency compared to HTTP/1.1, which relies on multiple connections.

Header Compression: HTTP/2 compresses header information, reducing overhead and improving performance. HTTP/1.1 sends headers in plaintext, leading to higher data transfer.

Binary Protocol: HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol instead of plain text, making it more compact and efficient for data transfer. HTTP/1.1 uses a text-based format, which is less optimized.

Server Push: HTTP/2 supports server push, enabling servers to proactively send resources to the client before they are requested, reducing latency. HTTP/1.1 lacks this feature.

Prioritization: HTTP/2 allows for the prioritization of resources, ensuring critical resources are loaded first. In HTTP/1.1, resources are requested and loaded in the order they are encountered, without prioritization.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?

Answer:

1. Key-Value Structure:
   JavaScript objects store data in key-value pairs, providing a versatile way to organize information.

2. Properties and Methods:
   Objects encapsulate data with properties and functionalities with methods, both internally represented for efficient access.

3. Prototypes and Inheritance:
   Objects use prototypes for inheritance, creating a chain for property and method resolution.

4. Memory Representation:
   Internally, objects employ dictionaries and hidden classes, dynamically allocating memory for flexibility.

5. JSON Serialization:
   JavaScript objects easily convert to JSON, a text-based format, streamlining data interchange and storage.
